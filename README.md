# ðŸŒ± AGRISISTANCE

**A2SV-Agrisistance** is an AI-driven web application designed to assist African farmers in optimizing land use and maximizing crop productivity. By employing advanced machine learning algorithms and data analytics, AGRISISTANCE delivers actionable insights and personalized recommendations tailored to each farming scenario.

## **Features**

### **1. Predicting the Best Crops to Invest In**

This feature uses a machine learning model to identify the most suitable crops based on soil parameters. Key factors include:
- **Oxygen Levels**
- **Potassium, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus Levels**
- **pH Levels**
- **Humidity Levels**

These parameters can be gathered from IoT devices, manually entered, or web-scraped using OpenAI APIs. The model processes this data to recommend the best crops for investment.

### **2. Optimizing Land Use and Budget**

The optimization feature utilizes genetic algorithms and hill-climbing techniques to determine the ideal crop-to-price-to-area combinations. Inputs include:
- Crop recommendations from the prediction model
- Total budget
- Estimated costs for each crop

The output includes the optimal distribution of crops to maximize profit, considering the total budget and available land area.

### **3. Generating a Tailored Business Plan**

Using generative models and OpenAI, this feature creates a comprehensive business plan, including:
- **Statistical Analysis and Predictions**
- **Strategic Advice and Suggestions**
- **Cost and Resource Management Calculations**
- **Profit Expectations**

This plan provides farmers with actionable strategies for effective resource management and financial planning.
